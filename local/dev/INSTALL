# DEPLOYING THE DEVELOPER CREDITS PLUGIN AT MOODLE.ORG SITE #

Installation
============

Put the following line into config.php:

    $CFG->hidelocaldevfromnavigation = true;

Fetch the source code of the plugin:

    # cd /var/www/vhosts/moodle.org/html/local
    # git clone git://github.com/moodlehq/moodle-local_dev.git dev

Visit the /admin page to install the plugin as usually.

Add the following two lines to .htaccess to support nice top level URL:

    # local_dev
        RewriteRule ^dev($|(/(.*))) local/dev/$3 [L]

Post-installation setup via CLI
===============================

Prepare a mirror of the vanilla moodle.git repository in the server moodledata:

    # cd /var/www/vhosts/moodle.org/data
    # mkdir -p local_dev/repos
    # chown -R apache:apache local_dev
    # cd local_dev/repos
    # nice git clone --mirror git://git.moodle.org/moodle.git
    # chown -R apache:apache moodle.git

Run cli/git-commits.php to register commits history in the database:

    # cd /var/www/vhosts/moodle.org/html/local/dev/cli
    # nice sudo -u apache /usr/bin/php git-commits.php --show-progress

Import the initial pre-computed tags mapping:

    # cd /var/www/vhosts/moodle.org/html/local/dev/cli
    # nice sudo -u apache /usr/bin/php git-tags.php --import=../init/tags.txt --show-progress

Import the initial pre-computed legacy CVS mappings:

    # cd /var/www/vhosts/moodle.org/html/local/dev/cli
    # nice sudo -u apache /usr/bin/php git-aliases.php --import=../init/legacyusers.txt

Run cli/aggregate.php to generate initial reports for display

    # cd /var/www/vhosts/moodle.org/html/local/dev/cli
    # nice sudo -u apache /usr/bin/php aggregate.php

Post-installation setup via WWW
===============================

Go to Site administration ► Users ► Permissions ► Define roles and define new role:

    Role name:      Developers plugin manager
    Short name:     localdevmanager
    Description:    Can manage the local_dev plugin
    Role archetype: None
    Context types:  System

    Allow:          Manage the Developers plugin (local/dev:manage)

Go to Site administration ► Users ► Permissions ► Assign system roles and assign
the new role to the user with email "david@moodle.com" (userid 1601)

Tell David to continue with the setup (he will have to map Git users to existing Moodle users).

Scheduling regular tasks to be executed
=======================================

Let the aggregate script run every hour or so to update the data that are displayed at the
web pages of the plugin:

    37 * * * * apache /usr/bin/php aggregate.php

To process new Git commits in moodle.git, the following sequence of scripts should be
executed (you may want to prepare a separate shell script for that). They should be executed as
soon as possible after the moodle.git repository update (that is after every weekly build).
As there can be some emergency releases or irregular weekly update, it makes sense to run
these scripts once per day (the execution is pretty cheap):

    07 00 * * * apache /usr/bin/php git-commits.php > /some/log/file ; /usr/bin/php git-aliases.php ; /usr/bin/php git-tags.php

Making the plugin visible to the world
======================================

The data will be available at http://moodle.org/dev and http://moodle.org/dev/contributions.php and
everybody who knows these URLs will be able to review and test it. Once we are happy with it, just
remove the hidelocaldevfromnavigation flag from config.php or set it to false.

Done!
