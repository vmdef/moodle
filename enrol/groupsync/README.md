Cohort members to group
=======================

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/moodlehq/moodle-enrol_groupsync.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/moodlehq/moodle-enrol_groupsync)

This Moodle enrolment plugin synchronises cohort and group memberships. It does
not make any user enrolments. Only users that are enrolled via other enrolment
method are automatically put into groups based on their cohort membership.
